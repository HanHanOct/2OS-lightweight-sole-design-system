# 2OS - Personalized Porous Lightweight Sole Design System for 3D Printing

## üìñ Project Overview

This project is a design system for creating personalized, porous, and lightweight insoles intended for 3D printing.

As 3D printing technology continues to evolve, customized footwear has become a significant trend impacting the global athletic shoe market. However, there is a noticeable gap in the market for comprehensive services that offer truly personalized, lightweight sole design. This system was developed to fill that gap by providing an end-to-end solution for custom insole generation, from user data input to a print-ready 3D model.

## üöÄ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Three.js, Layui
- **Backend**: Node.js, Java (Spring Boot)
- **Database**: MySQL
- **3D Model Processing**: The core pipeline involves converting `.obj` files to `.gltf` and then applying Draco compression.
